# videoflow-contrib: Videoflow community contributions
This library is the official extension repository for the Videoflow library. 
It contains additional consumers, producers, processors, subflows, etc. which are not yet available within Videoflow itself. 
All of these additional modules can be used in conjunction with core Videoflow flows.
This is done in the interest of keeping Videoflow succinct, clean, and simple, with as minimal dependencies to third-party
libraries as necessaries.

This contribution repository is both the proving ground for new functionality, and the archive for functionality that (while useful) may not fit well into the Videoflow paradigm.
